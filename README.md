This repository demonstrates a subtle error related to pointer arithmetic in C.  The provided `bug.c` shows code that appears to function correctly at first glance. However,  the solution (`bugSolution.c`) illustrates the potential problems and offers a more robust approach. The main issue revolves around the potential for unexpected behavior if pointer arithmetic is not handled carefully, especially in situations involving array access or memory allocation. This example serves as a reminder of the importance of careful pointer management in C programming.
